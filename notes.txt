- image with encode url for many options are not possible copy and paste(see scripts/download_encode_img.sh)

when testing with front-end images is broken at the moment.

- docker compose, it seems to be able to see changes locally I need to delete the image 
- there is no build for this app, docker compose will build it
- docker compose is the V2 and does not accept passing vars on the command line, at least at the date writing here
run

docker compose up
  see .env

Passing to react app did not work, I guess only via .env(in the react project) starting with "REACT_APP"
